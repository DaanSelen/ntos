Nerthus Thin Operating System (NTOS).<br>
What is it? What problem does it solve?<br>
NTOS tries to solve the problem where enterprise-grade ThinClient operating systems cost a lot of money for relatively less features (in my opinion).<br>

This is where NTOS comes in: - it is based on Debian for stability and security - it can run on as small of a harddrive as 4GB with 2GB RAM (tested) - and it is very minimal.<br>
It (NTOS) specifically uses a Debian installation with a customized Desktop Environment (DE) (XFCE4) to minimize the points of "trouble" a user can cause.<br>

It offers a way to connect to cloud environments (currently only RDP-based) in a easy and straight-to-the-point method using the Credcon (Bash script) üòÅ.<br>

I added ways to set-up a server for installation (perhaps I can add PXE in the future). And a guide to get started! Feel free to open an issue or email me.

## How to Install:

The following section explains how to apply this.<br>
I also made a YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZEBjlq8x00):

### Prerequisites:
- A configured remote management system, such as MeshCentral (the installation of such a system is beyond the scope of NTOS).<br>
Such a remote management system often provides a way to install an agent. To incorporate this into the NTOS installation do:<br>
Paste your installation commands into the root part, for example: `./configs/minimal/finish.sh at line 74 to 76`.

    > If you do not configure a remote management system, then your system will be hard to debug or trouble-shoot (because of the fool-proof nature).<br>
    > Personally I've used MeshCentral which is free and works great! Link is [here](https://github.com/Ylianst/MeshCentral)

- A Debian installation medium, such as an USB-stick with Debian net(work)-inst(allation) or the CD/DVD media flashed onto it. (For flashing see: [rufus](https://rufus.ie/) / [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher))<br>

- Networking connectivity. (DHCP is easiest and fastest)

### How to Setup a Webserver with NTOS-files:

1.  To set everything up, execute the `setup.sh` bash script and answer its questions.<br>
    Once that's done, you can verify that with (configure to your own situation):<br>
    `curl http://localhost/configs/minimal/preseed.cfg`.<br>
    This should output the Debian preseed for the minimal configuration.<br>

# How to Debug?

If you are encountering issues with - most likely connecting the actual RDP session. Follow these steps!<br>
Make sure you have exported the correct DISPLAY environment variable.<br>
The way I do this - is in MeshCentral I enter the `Terminal` tab and enter `export DISPLAY=:0`.<br>

> This makes sure all graphical apps pop-up on the actual monitor!

Then if you want to debug `Credcon` do the following:

```shell
bash ~/Templates/credcon.sh
```

This will print the output to the current terminal, while keeping the GUI/Dialogue boxes on the monitor!

Example output:
```text
user@NTOS:~/Templates$ bash credcon.sh

The above example shows a `ACCESS_DENIED` error.

## Webserver Endpoint-structure:

The Bash `install.sh`-scripts are there for copying the needed files to the specificied location on the system, preferably from a webserver root into the ~(user)/Templates.

The following endpoints are available by default after installing using `install.sh` (assuming success). This is needed for the new machine to set itself up.

```shell
/assets/desktop.png 	        # This file will be used as the background for the installed device. Replacing must be done by exactly coping the name + filename extension.
/aseets/gtk.css                 # This file applies some styling to make the UI look more modern and appealing.
/assets/panel-profile.tar.bz2   # XFCE4 Panel profile.
/credcon/credcon.sh             # Bash script for asking user credentials (for the RDP connection).
/configs/minimal/preseed.cfg    # The Debian preseed file for the minimal configuration (~4GB).
/configs/default/preseed.cfg    # The default Debian preseed file.
/configs/minimal/finish.sh      # The Bash script that applies all settings with a modification for support on small drives.
/configs/default/finish.sh      # The default bash script.
/rdp/<your-templates>           # Directory endpoint for premade '.rdp' files (for example /rdp/demo.rdp). You NEED to populate this yourself.
```

The above `/rdp` endpoint requires you to place premade `.rdp` files in the directory before running `setup.sh`.<br>
Then the finish script will ask for which one to pick.

## Epilogue

I am happy I am finally able to present something I am actually very fond of, this project.<br>
I've tried to make this environment as fool-proof as possible so that non-technical people can work with this. I always appreciate feedback.<br>
Thanks<br>
