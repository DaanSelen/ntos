# Before using this utility, make sure the firmware blobs are on: https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
# For example for i915 and xe, see: https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/i915

# It looks like kernel.org has a timeout policy. Therefor it can at max download 5 files per second. Which just takes some time if you want it correctly.
# If you notice incomplete pulls, increase the wait in the wget command. This will slow down the downloads, decreasing risk of being blocked.
#
# Example usage:
# su root -c "bash /opt/ntos/bin/install-firmware.sh"
